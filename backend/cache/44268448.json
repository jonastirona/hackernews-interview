Over the years I've touched base with folks who helped me out at crucial times and they didn't even remember the incident. Like one time when I was not offered a job after an internship, this senior guy stepped in and made sure they gave me an offer. I thanked him 20 years later for helping me get my start. He just said, \"Really? I don't recall that, but glad I could help.\" So paying it forward is probably the best strategy.", "depth": 0}, {"author": "steveBK123", "text": "I think in some cases it's because the type of person who would go above & beyond to help just naturally does this as their normal course of business.

He was incredibly approachable and always generous with his time. If he sensed your curiosity, he’d give you his full, undivided attention.\n\nJust weeks before he passed, we were trading long Twitter DMs late into the evening—deep, technical conversations spanning topics that were hard to get good information on elsewhere.\n\nAfter his passing, as I began sharing these stories, I found that so many others had experienced the exact same generosity from him. He had a remarkable way of making people feel seen and supported.", "depth": 2}, {"author": "strangattractor", "text": "My personal rule: Always try and help people whenever the opportunity arrises (especially people you don't know). It doesn't matter how small the assistance or if you will see this person again. You might be surprised at how it feels and the knock on effects that occur. Once I started looking for opportunities I found them everywhere.\n\nTreating people shitty has no reward, takes zero effort and minimal intelligence.", "depth": 1}, {"author": "kylecazar", "text": "\"and then disappear into the night like some kind of helpful spirit of the hacker night.\"\n\nThis is awesome.

His excitement and curiosity was contagious. We’d connect at events over the years and he’d always have something interesting to show off. Jet airplane explosion videos ran through MRI software?

I wish I'd gotten to know him.\n\nPiling-on your story: I'd love to know who the guy was I hung out with at Defcon 3. My friends' flights were earlier than mine and I ended up alone in Las Vegas, newly-turned 18 y/o and w/ very little travel experience outside of Ohio.\n\nI ended up hanging out talking with a Unix hacker in his mid-late 20s who struck up a conversation w/ me on the con floor. We hung out the rest of Sunday until my flight left. It made what otherwise would have been a lonely and stressful day a lot of fun.\n\nHe gave me an email address to hit him up after the con. It turned out to be fake. I've never been able to find any references to his \"name\", the domain name on the email, etc. I don't know if he gave me the fake address because of the stigma of a \"hacker con\"(being worried about real identities, etc). I hope it wasn't because he just didn't want to hear from me again (albeit I do recognize I was pretty insufferable at that age).\n\nIf you remember hanging out w/ a long-haired kid on the last Saturday of Defcon 3 I'd love to touch base.
