In some cases it’s because an executive believes it will be good evidence for them having done everything right in case of a breach.\n\nPoint being the people implementing it usually know it’s a bad idea and so do the people asking for it. But politics and incentives are aligned with it being safer for the individuals to go along with it.", "depth": 0}, {"author": "BitwiseFool", "text": "I belonged to an organization that had password complexity requirements. That's normal and understandable. However one requirement was that no part of my password could contain a three character subsstring that was included in my full name. I won't give my real name here, but sadly it includes some three letter subsequences that are somewhat common in many English words. I can understand a policy that prevents someone from using \"matthew1234\" as Matthew Smith's password, but this rule also prevents such a person from using \"correcthorsebatterystaple\" because it has 'att' in it.\n\nTurns out, this rule was not from IT. It was a requirement from the cybersecurity insurance policy the organization had taken.", "depth": 1}, {"author": "lesuorac", "text": "> Turns out, this rule was not from IT.

If you change the policy, though, then you're at risk of being held personally responsible if something goes wrong. Even if the change isn't related to the problem.\n\nIt's not just cybersecurity. I have a family member who was a medical director, and ran up against it whenever he wanted to update hospital policies and standards of care to reflect new findings. Legal would throw a shitfit about it every time. With the way tort law in the US works, the solution to the trolley problem is always \"don't throw the switch\" because as soon as you touch it you're involved and can be held responsible for what happens.", "depth": 3}, {"author": "leoc", "text": "\"No-one ever got fired for buying IBM\" etc.", "depth": 4}, {"author": "lucideer", "text": "> But these don't seem to be authoritative enough for IT / security,\n\nAs someone who's worked for a cybersecurity team that was responsible for enforcing password rotations in a company, trust me when I say that nobody was more eager to ditch the requirement than we were. This is enforced by external PCI auditors & nobody else.\n\nFwiw, PCI DSS 4.0 has slightly relaxed this requirement by allowing companies to opt-out of password rotation if they meet a set of other criteria, but individuals employed as auditors tend to be stuck in their ways & have proved slow to adapt the 4.x changes when performing their reviews. They've tended to push for rotation rather than bothered to evaluate the extra criteria.", "depth": 5}, {"author": "SAI_Peregrinus", "text": "Does anyone not add the year & month of the last password change to the end of their password? E.g. PascalCasePassphraseGoesHere2025-06, then at the next required change in (for example) 6 months: PascalCasePassphraseGoesHere2026-01. It almost certainly fits the inane \"letter, number, and special character\" requirements they probably have, complies with \"different from your last X passwords\", and is easy to keep track of the change interval. It also adds no security whatsoever!
