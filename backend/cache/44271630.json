While Material Design wouldn't be released until 2014, you can see them moving in that direction from Gingerbread to Jelly Bean, particularly when looking at the system components and first-party apps, since this was before the concept of a unified design language across third-party apps had been formalized.\n\nAt the time Apple introduced their flat design in June 2013, they were the odd ones out. In fact, I remember a Daring Fireball article posted in spring 2013 (a few months before WWDC) praising Apple for leading the pack in flat design, and HN excoriating it for making what was at the time a clearly preposterous claim.", "depth": 0}, {"author": "bitpush", "text": "> While the tech press fixated on Apple's relatively quiet AI story at WWDC 2025, the company was executing a more subtle strategy. Rather than engaging in the current LLM arms race (where it's demonstrably behind), Apple doubled down on what it does best: creating compelling user experiences through design and integration.\n\nI cant believe real people actually believe this kind of stuff. The author seems to think tech press alone is fixated on AI story. Apple themselves was all gung-ho about AI last time around. They sold an entire line of iPhones touting the benefits of AI. They even \"invented\" a brand for their line of offering - Apple Intelligence.\n\nAnd when it all fell flat, Apple had to apologize and had to (yes, had to) showcase other things. Liquid Glass essentially was a replacement for that. If Apple had anything meaningful to show in AI world, it would have show cased that.\n\nAnd author seems to think Apple is playing 4D chess. Sometimes the simplest explanation is what is really going on.", "depth": 1}, {"author": "bombcar", "text": "The reality distortion field didn’t die with Jobs.", "depth": 0}, {"author": "xnx", "text": "Also, no evidence that Liquid Glass isn't a bad UI for AR too.\n\nJohn Carmack writes:\n\nTranslucent UI is usually a bad idea outside of movies and non-critical game interfaces.\n\nThe early moments of joy are fleeting, while the usability issues remain. Windows and Mac have both been down this road before, but I guess a new generation of designers needs to learn the lessons anew. Sigh.\n\nAll of the same issues apply in AR as well. Outside of movies, people do not work out their thoughts on windowpanes or transparent “whiteboards” because of the exact same legibility issues.\n\nWould you prefer a notebook of white sheets, or hundreds of different blurry image backgrounds?\n\nhttps://x.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1932521605340483607", "depth": 1}, {"author": "evanextreme", "text": "As a visionOS user (somewhat) what is so funny about all of this is that the translucency effects in visionOS are significantly toned down compared to liquid glass for this specific reason. The glass is heavily diffused, you can maybe get an idea of what is behind (a person moving, a television thats turned on) but nothing even close to the level that I have experienced in the iPadOS beta", "depth": 0}, {"author": "hxtk", "text": "I’ve definitely been preferring a transparent background on my terminal lately, particularly when I only have one screen, because it increases my ability to read the reference material I have opened behind it. At the very least, if I have to alt-tab it out of the way, I’m already oriented on the page. So I can see the benefit in at least some use cases.\n\nI don’t think I’d like to have it on everything, though. Or basically anything except my terminal, for that matter.", "depth": 1}, {"author": "bee_rider", "text": "> Would you prefer a notebook of white sheets, or hundreds of different blurry image backgrounds?\n\nWeird tangent, but I used tracing paper over piece of graph paper for notes for a while. I liked it because I could use the graph paper for drawing my figures or align my text, but then have something more aesthetically pleasing and nice for reading after. I find reading on graph paper annoying, due to the vertical lines.\n\nAnyway, I can’t think of any way that a transparent OS window could be similarly helpful.", "depth": 1}, {"author": "didgeoridoo", "text": "I think the issue is less about whether it’s a good idea or not, but rather that AR interfaces essentially HAVE to be translucent (unless you’re doing video passthrough) — so might as well figure out how to get it right.", "depth": 1}, {"author": "manmal", "text": "I get the legibility argument, but if you want to make an AR device that’s safe to use in _any_ context, you just can’t occlude the environment. People would have accidents because of that - as drivers, but also while walking or just bumping into things while putting something in the fridge.\n\nFor walls of text you can still opt out of this and use a less translucent material.", "depth": 1}, {"author": "iw7tdb2kqo9", "text": "Liquid glass looks great on the \"Meet Liquid Glass\" video.
