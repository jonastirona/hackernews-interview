She\nwas studying how morning glories disperse protective chemicals called “ergot\nalkaloids” through their roots when she saw evidence of a fungus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">“We had a ton of plants\nlying around and they had these tiny little seed coats,” she said. “We noticed a\nlittle bit of fuzz in the seed coat. That was our fungus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">The researchers prepared a DNA sample\nand sent it away for genome sequencing, funded by a </span><a href=\"https://www.davis.wvu.edu/current-students/student-enhancement-grants\" style=\"font-size: 1em; background-color: white;\">WVU Davis\nCollege Student Enhancement Grant</a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\"> obtained by Hazel. The sequencing confirmed\nthe discovery of a new species and the sequence is now deposited in a gene bank\nwith her name on it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">“Sequencing a genome is a significant\nthing,” Panaccione said. “It’s amazing for a student.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Morning glory plants live\nin symbiosis with fungi that produce the same ergot alkaloids the Swiss chemist\nAlbert Hofmann modified when he invented LSD in the late 1930s.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Hofmann hypothesized that\na fungus in morning glories produced alkaloids similar to those in LSD, but the\nspecies remained a mystery until Hazel and Panaccione’s discovery. They published their findings in </span><a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00275514.2025.2483634\" style=\"font-size: 1em; background-color: white;\">Mycologia</a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">“Morning glories contain\nhigh concentrations of similar lysergic acid derivatives that give them their\npsychedelic activities,” Panaccione said. “This inspired Hofmann and others to\ninvestigate morning glories for the presence of a hidden fungus related to the\nergot fungus that might be the source of these chemicals. They found very\nsimilar chemicals, but they could never find the fungus itself.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Ergot alkaloids are made\nexclusively by fungi. In addition to morning glories, they’re often found\ngrowing on grains like rye. They can be poisonous to humans and livestock and, when\nused therapeutically, can have unwanted side effects. Still, some clinicians use\nthem to treat conditions like migraines, dementia, uterine hemorrhaging and\nParkinson’s disease.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Periglandula clandestina is highly\nefficient at making ergot alkaloids in large quantities, a characteristic that may\nplay a role in future pharmaceuticals. The discovery of the fungus o</span><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">pens a host of potential research\navenues, Panaccione said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">“Many things are toxic. But if you\nadminister them in the right dosage or modify them, they can be useful\npharmaceuticals. By studying them, we may be able to figure out ways to bypass\nthe side effects. These are big issues for medicine and agriculture.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">The researchers dubbed the fungus “Periglandula\nclandestina” for its ability to have eluded investigators for decades.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">“I think that’s the perfect name,”\nPanaccione said. “And I love that we did this project together. Corinne has a\nton of talent. It’s about students recognizing the opportunities, seizing them\nand having the skill and the brain power to bring this work to fruition.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Hazel is now studying the most\neffective ways to culture the slow-growing fungus and is interested in whether other\nmorning glory species may also contain ergot alkaloids from a fungal symbiote\nthat has yet to be described.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">“I’m lucky to have stumbled into this\nopportunity,” she said. “People have been looking for this fungus for years,\nand one day, I look in the right place, and there it is. I’m very proud of the\nwork that I’ve done at WVU.”</span></p>\n<p><b style=\"font-size: 1em;\">-WVU-</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">lj/6/2/25</span></p>\n<p>MEDIA CONTACT: Laura

addiction.  This groundbreaking discovery, made while studying morning glory plants, unlocks the secrets of naturally occurring compounds similar to those in the semisynthetic drug LSD.", "top_comments": [], "analysis": {"analysis": "**1. Summary:** A West Virginia University student, Corinne Hazel, discovered a new fungus species, *Periglandula clandestina*, residing in morning glory plants. This fungus produces ergot alkaloids, similar to those used in LSD, potentially offering new avenues for treating various medical conditions, a mystery that had eluded researchers since the 1930s.  The discovery was published in *Mycologia*.\n\n\n**2. Key Points:**\n\n* **Novel Fungus Discovery:** Hazel discovered a new species of fungus, *Periglandula clandestina*, within morning glory plants.\n* **Ergot Alkaloid Production:** The fungus produces ergot alkaloids, compounds similar to those found in LSD and used in some medical treatments.\n* **Historical Significance:** This discovery solves a long-standing mystery regarding the source of ergot alkaloids in morning glories, a question posed by LSD's inventor, Albert Hofmann.\n* **Potential Medical Applications:** The fungus's high efficiency in producing ergot alkaloids suggests potential for pharmaceutical applications in treating various conditions.\n* **Genome Sequencing:** The fungus's genome was sequenced, confirming its novelty and securing its place in a gene bank.\n* **Publication:** The findings were published in the peer-reviewed journal *Mycologia*.\n\n\n**3. Discussion Highlights:** (Since no comments were provided, this section will address potential discussion points based on the article):\n\n* **Ethical Considerations:**  The connection to LSD, even though the fungus produces similar compounds for different purposes, may raise ethical concerns about potential misuse or the creation of new psychoactive substances.  Discussions around responsible research and regulation would be crucial.\n* **Pharmaceutical Potential:** The article highlights the potential for therapeutic applications.  Further research is needed to explore the specific medical benefits, dosage, and safety profiles of the ergot alkaloids produced by *P. clandestina*.  Comparison with existing ergot alkaloid treatments would be essential.\n* **Ecological Significance:** The symbiotic relationship between the fungus and morning glory plants warrants further investigation. Understanding this interaction could reveal insights into plant-fungal relationships and the broader ecosystem.\n* **Future Research:**  The genome sequence opens doors for detailed studies of the fungus's metabolic pathways, potentially leading to optimized production of specific ergot alkaloids for therapeutic use.  Studies on the fungus's growth conditions and scalability are also important for potential pharmaceutical applications.\n* **Scientific Rigor:** The use of genome sequencing and publication in a reputable journal underscores the scientific rigor of the research.  This adds credibility to the findings and sets a high standard for future studies.", "metadata": {"model": "gemini-1.5-flash", "content_length": 7017, "comments_analyzed": 0}}, "has_more": true}
