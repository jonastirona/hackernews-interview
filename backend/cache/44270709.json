I really enjoyed my free Palm Pre.\n\nI tried resurrecting it a few years ago but couldnâ€™t find a replacement battery after the original died.", "depth": 0}, {"author": "bluGill", "text": "The price was likely too high, though that is debatable. However the real take away is if you want something like this to work out you need to invest in to for years. There is nothing wrong with getting the size of the market wrong by that much - it happens too often for anyone to call it wrong. It isn't clear what was predicted, but marketing should have predicted a range of units sold (and various price points having different predicted ranges!).\n\nThey didn't have the app ecosystem - no surprise. However the only way to get that ecosystem is years of investment. The Windows phone failed a couple years latter for similar reasons - nice device (or so I'm told), but it wasn't out long enough to get a lot of apps before Microsoft gave up on it.", "depth": 1}, {"author": "joecool1029", "text": "> There is nothing wrong with getting the size of the market wrong by that much - it happens too often for anyone to call it wrong.

Whatever initial enthusiasm there was for Windows Phone quickly disappeared when they added that requirement. When they finally figured out it wasn't going to be a new revenue stream, they reduced it for a while instead of eliminating it. When they finally realized just how badly they had messed up and removed all the fees, most developers had already moved on and never gave Windows Phone another look.\n\nIt reminds me of the failure of Windows Home Server. It was removed from MSDN because the product manager said developers needed to buy a copy of it if they wanted to develop extensions and products for Home Server. Very few bothered. However many dozen licenses the policy lead to being purchased was dwarfed by the failure of the product to gain market share. Obviously that wasn't only due to alienating developers but it certainly was part of it.", "depth": 3}], "analysis": {"analysis": "Content could not be fetched for analysis.", "metadata": {"error": "No content available", "model": "gemini-1.5-flash"}}, "has_more": true}
