HP priced the TouchPad at $499 to compete directly with the iPad, but without the app ecosystem or marketing muscle to justify that premium. The device felt rushed to market, lacking the polish that could have helped it compete.\"\n\nHe claims to have been working with Palm closely for a year, yet he somehow must have missed how bad things were. The product was a week or two away from launch when he had to step away.

However the real take away is if you want something like this to work out you need to invest in to for years.

It isn't clear what was predicted, but marketing should have predicted a range of units sold (and various price points having different predicted ranges!).\n\nThey didn't have the app ecosystem - no surprise.
