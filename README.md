## Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **Frontend Request**
   - User loads the application
   - Angular service makes SSE connection to backend
   - Initial batch of stories requested

2. **Backend Processing**
   ```

   SSE Stream to Frontend
   ```

3. **AI Analysis Pipeline**
   - Article content is extracted and cleaned
   - Screenshot is captured with anti-bot measures
   - Content is sent to Gemini API for:
     - Article hook generation (2-3 sentence summary)
     - Basic article analysis with comments

## Future Improvements

4. **Features**
   - User authentication
   - Saved articles
   - Custom feeds
   - Share functionality

## Scaling Strategy

### Resource Management
- **Playwright Sessions**
  - Async queue for browser instances
  - Connection pooling
  - Automatic cleanup
  - Error recovery

### API Optimization
- **Gemini API**
  - Worker pool for parallel processing
  - Request batching
  - Response caching
  - Rate limiting

### Anti-Ban Measures
- Domain-specific rate limiting
- Rotating user agents
- Request delays
- IP rotation support

### Caching Strategy
- File system for article content and screenshots
- Memory cache for API responses
- Browser cache headers

### Concurrency
- Job-based request tracking
- User session management
- Resource allocation per user
- Queue prioritization
